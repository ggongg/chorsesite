Ripple: Your Mental Health Ally. 
First, I designed the UI/UX in Figma, then transferred the designs and images onto the website frontend. 
I also utilized the Google Cloud Platform Dialogflow Tool to create the chatbot, which I then integrated within the site. 

Some things Im working on adding: 
* API's to enhance the chatbot and website functionality 
* Additional pages 
* Additional features for the site 

The website works, and the chatbot can be tested here: https://ripplechat.netlify.app/
